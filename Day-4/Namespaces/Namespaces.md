# Assignment- 2 : Namespaces 

**Importance of namespaces in large systems**

>Namespaces are fundamental in large systems for preventing naming conflicts, organizing code into logical units, and providing a mechanism for resource isolation and access control.

>**Avoid Naming Collisions**:- in large system with thosands of identifiers, the chances of naming collisions increase significantly. Namespaces help to avoid these collisions by encapsulating identifiers within a specific context.

>**Code Organization and Modularity**:-It allows developers to  maintain the codebase.

>**Improved Readability and Maintainability**:-By using meaningful namespace names, it becomes clear which part of the system an identifier belongs to. it simplify the maintanance.

>**Versioning and Compatibility**:-in some programming language namespace uses as a versoning mechanism. This allows different versions of an API to exist in the same system,so user can choose which version to use.

>**Efficient Resource Management**:-Namespaces enable administrators to set resource limits.for different sections of a system, ensuring fair usage preventing any single component from monopolizing resources.
