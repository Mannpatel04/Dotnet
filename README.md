# Assignment-2 Operations-Theory

**Explain:
           Difference between == and Equals()
           Short-circuit behavior in logical operators**
>(==)Operator: The '==' operator is used to compare the values of two operands to determine if they are equal. For value types, it compares the actual values, while for reference types, it checks if both references point to the same object in memory unless the operator is overloaded.
>(Equals())Method: The 'Equals()' method is a member of the Object class and can be overridden in derived classes to provide custom equality logic. By default, it behaves similarly to '==' for reference types (checking reference equality) but can be customized to compare the contents of objects.
